							<h3 >Masking Sensitive Data using NLP (Master's Project TTU)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/nlp.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									‚Ä¢	Creation of Scam call datasets manually, i.e., recording calls with sentiments, as there not many transcribed call datasets available on the Internet where we can work on. In future the call datasets can be used for Sentiment analysis and train the computer on identifying scam calls on the sentiment of the caller and the information being transferred during the call.<br>
									‚Ä¢	Identification and masking of Sensitive Data using Natural Language Tool Kit.<br>
									‚Ä¢	TFIDF Vectorization- Converted transcribed call data into tokens of tokens and then vectorized the data to get values according to the data.<br>
									‚Ä¢	Cosine similarity- Created new datasets for phone number, names, states etc., and vectorized them to get values and compared those values with the values obtained from the vectorization of transcribed call data using cosine similarity to find sensitive data.<br>
									‚Ä¢	Regular Expressions- This is another method to Identify and mask sensitive data. Here we used regular expression such as zip_code="^[1-9][0-9]{3}[1-8]$" for finding zip codes in the transcribed call dataset and mask it.<br>
								</p>
							
							<h3 >Online Shopping Portal </h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/online.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								‚Ä¢	Developed an application that is an online store for the sale of various types of electronic items. <br>
								‚Ä¢	The application was built using Hyper Text Markup Language and the designing and texture was built using Cascading Style Sheets. <br>
								‚Ä¢	I have used local database as well which has been connected to the application using NetBeans which works with Java Script. <br>

							</p>

							
							<h3 >Fake Currency Detection</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/fakecurr.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								‚Ä¢	This project aims at building a solution to detect a fake bill by image processing and computer vision techniques. <br>
								‚Ä¢	The system consists of three main algorithms and checks the authenticity of various features in a currency note. <br>
								‚Ä¢	The first algorithm consists of several steps including image acquisition, pre-processing, greyscale conversion, feature extraction, image segmentation, comparisons of images and output, and uses advanced image processing methods such as ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index). <br>
								‚Ä¢	The second algorithm authenticates the bleed lines of the currency notes whereas the third algorithm authenticates the number panel of the currency notes. <br>
								‚Ä¢	Finally, the processed output is displayed for each currency note. <br>
							</p>

							<h3 >Product Rating Based on Customer Reviews</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/product.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								‚Ä¢	Analysis of the data set of reviews and classifies the data to give a rating of the product using data mining algorithms. <br>
								‚Ä¢	The rating and review given by each customer is clearly reviewed by the machine using various machine learning algorithms, and then the review/rating is classified as positive or negative and the final average rating of the product is decided. <br>
